    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted.

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "Looking at the graphs, following observations can be made (naive models):\n",
    "- SVM model takes the longest time (as mentioned before SVM has complexity which involves increase in processing time) for training and predicting compared to decision tree classifier and random forest classifier(which are almost insignificant on comparision), also the time increases with increase in number of samples. \n",
    "- Accuracy score (irrespective of the training set size for all models) on training and testing set for SVM is almost the same, where as we see there is noticable difference of 0.1 to 0.2 in scores for other two models. The decision tree and random forest classifier performs very well (with a score reaching 1) on training set but the on testing set their performance drops to a score around 0.8 and less. \n",
    "- F score on training and testing set SVM is almost the same for all training set size(1%,10%,100%), where as we see there is noticable difference of 0.4 to 0.5 in scores for other two models. The decision tree and random forest classifier performs very well (with a score reaching 1) on training set but the on testing set their performance drops to a score as less as 0.6 and 0.5. \n",
    "- Fscore is 0 when training set size is 1%, for both testing and training sets, this might be because when we split the data there might be no examples of  (with one missing classification category) either >50K (as 1) or <=50k (0) and Fscore considers number of examples predicted correctly for both categories, hence the warning saying Fscore set to 0 as there are no predicted samples for one catgeory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I believe SVM is most appropriate model for identifying individuals that make more than 50K, because it performs consitently in both training and testing data, without huge variation unlike other models which perform very well on training and not so good on testing data. SVM definetly takes more time to train and test based on the input size, but gives good prediction with accuracy score of approx 80% (basic/naive one, might be more if we tweak some hyperparameters) most of the times for any test training set size(1%, 10% or 100%). F-score of SVM is around 0.6 given the data with examples of both the categories(>50K and <=50K). \n",
    "\n",
    "We train the model with only 1% of data and predict on entire test set and receive approximately (near to 80-85% of accuracy) the same prediction when we train with more and more data which indicates that we dont need lot of data to predict on test set, which is an advantage with SVM.  \n",
    "We observe that other two models (decision trees and random forest) also have accuracy and f1 scores closer to each other on training set but on testing their scores match approximately to SVM. So given any amount of data on trianing, they are still not able to generalize well hence have less testing scores. \n",

    "SVM is a machine learning algorithm which is used for classification problems, it plotts each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features we have in our data) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate, next performs classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well.SVM does this by - model searches for the closest points which it calls the \"support vectors\" (the name \"support vector machine\" is due to the fact that points are like vectors and that the best line \"depends on\" or is \"supported by\" the closest points).Once it obtains closest points, the SVM draws a line connecting them (assuming closest points from each category(>50K and <=50K)). It draws this connecting line by doing vector subtraction. The support vector machine then declares the best separating line to be the line that bisects -- and is perpendicular to -- the connecting line.\n",

    "In our code above, we split the data in 1%,10% and 100% of the training data (36177 samples) which comes down to training model on 361 samples first, then do prediction on test set (9045 samples) and on the train set(300 samples), finally compute f score and accuracy score, repeat the same for 10% and 100%. Here we train the model by increasing dataset from 1 to 10 and to 100 percent, and test its performance/abiltiy to predict on entire test dataset each time.\n",

I missed hours-per week thinking some companies in different countries pay monthly basis and different countries have different style of working measurements, but it also makes sense the more you work , you get overpaid and gain more money. Also married couple, if both of them work then thier income together might be more, or more responsibilities leads to more necessity of better earning.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
